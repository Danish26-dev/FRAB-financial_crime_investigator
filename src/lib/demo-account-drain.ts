/**
 * TEMPORARY PROTECTION — Account-Drain Harness (SCN07 / MULE_PATTERN only).
 *
 * This is a FRONTEND-SCRIPTED demo harness. It does NOT touch the CVM
 * investigation worker or the bank. The detection, the "beneficiary frozen"
 * protection state, the state machine and its audit events are all simulated
 * client-side, and activate ONLY for the mule case (CASE0007).
 *
 * The ONE real integration is the VOICE VERIFICATION: it uses the live Vapi
 * voice service (see useVoiceEscalation), and the customer's REAL spoken
 * response decides whether protection is released or retained. The voice
 * result is never faked.
 *
 * Everything here is clearly surfaced in the UI as "TEMPORARY PROTECTION —
 * pending human review", never as a permanent bank action. The human analyst
 * remains the final decision-maker.
 *
 * Isolated + easy to remove after the hackathon: gated on ACCOUNT_DRAIN_CASE_ID.
